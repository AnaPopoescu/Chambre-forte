Happy people still feel the whole range of human emotions - anger, frustrastion, boredom, loneliness, and even sadness - from time to time. But even when faced with discomfort, they have an underlying sense of optimism that things will get better, that they can deal with what is happening, and that they will be able to feel happy again.&#128151;
